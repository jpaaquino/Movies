# Movies

### Overview
<p> The app will fetch a list of the upcoming movies from themoviedb API and populate a tableview. After you select a movie you will be directed to the Movie Details screen where you will be able to read more information about the movie.</p>

### Third Party Libraries 
<p> The only third party library used was Kingfisher for image downloading and caching because of the time requirement and complexity of implementing caching system</p>
<p> No other libraries were used because my personal preference is to use as few external libraries as possible </p>
